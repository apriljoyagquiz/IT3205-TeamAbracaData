## Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis for Overseas Filipino Workers

#### Introduction

#### Problem Statement

####Decreasing Professional Worker in a Community.
Since Filipino workers prefer to go overseas because of better salary opportunities, our country is losing a growing number of professional and hardworking individuals, which means a country needs skilled workers who will contribute to the improvement of society and the growth of the economy.


####Low Domestic Wages and Wage Differentials. 
Most international migrants in Asia are motivated by the prospect of earning higher wages overseas (Smart et al. 1986). As long as potential foreign earnings exceed local wages (after subtracting costs of movement and job placement), workers are likely to respond to higher foreign wage rates by engaging in labour migration to one of the regionâ€™s core migrant-receiving countries (Abella, 1988). Low earning capacity and unemployment contribute to the widening income gap between the rich and the poor. The Philippines has one of the worst income disparity records in Asia where the rich are very rich and the poor are very poor.


####The Philippine peso's value is falling. 
It is ironic that as the volume of dollar remittances to the Philippines increases, the value of a dollar decreases. This is because increased dollar reserves cause the greenback's value to fall against the peso. Because salaries are paid in foreign currencies influenced by the dollar-peso exchange rate, the peso value of OFW salaries falls.

#### Significance of the Proposed Project

#### To the Department of Labor and Employment. 
This study will assist the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in identifying and analyzing the employment needs of a country so that Filipino workers would choose to work for it. It would also support them in improving the overall quality of their governance, allowing them to adopt new ideas. These will help connect people and the government to facilitate communication, which will stand to gain the country's economy.

#### To the Future Researchers. 
The study's findings will be helpful to both existing and future researchers. It will be beneficial to researchers who want to organize better and execute their research, such as this one. This study was most likely one of the foundations for developing a new theory for data analysis.

#### To the Public and Society. 
This research will benefit both society and individuals since it will measure the statistics of Filipino workers who work for their families, allowing them to become more productive members of the community. It will assist citizens in becoming motivated to work, regardless of their gender, age, and status.
