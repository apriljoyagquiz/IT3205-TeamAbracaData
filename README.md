<h1 align="center"> Exploratory Data Analysis for Overseas Filipino Workers. </h1> 

### Introduction

<p align = "justify"> "Modern Day Heroes" is a title given for all Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) worldwide. They contribute to our country's economic progress through remittances. More importantly, they make personal sacrifices to provide a good living for their families despite homesickness. But working as an Overseas Filipino Worker is not always as straightforward as it appears. The truth is that they face a variety of problems in addition to abandoning their family in the Philippines to pursue a brighter future. Communication, finances, and the difficulties they face in their personal and professional lives are just a few of their issues. </p> 


<p align = "justify"> The Philippines is the fourth-largest beneficiary of remittances from abroad. Remittances from OFWs, on the whole, help the country's economic development by alleviating poverty and ensuring a steady cash flow and circulation. OFW remittances have not only met the basic needs of their families, but they have also helped to keep the country's economy afloat by providing liquidity throughout global financial crises. OFW remittances are the country's second largest source of foreign reserves. </p>

<p align = "justify"> OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) are Filipinos who labor in other nations. They move overseas in search of better possibilities to support their family back home in the Philippines. Because the labor abroad is under contract with their employers, they are sometimes known as "Overseas Contract Workers" (OCWs). There are two category of overseas Filipino workers: those who leave the country for temporary or contract work and those who permanently stay in their target country. Temporary migrant workers, classed as either land-based or sea-based workers, are called Overseas Filipino Workers, while permanent migrants are referred to as emigrants. </p>

<p align = "justify"> A steady salary and additional employment perks are two advantages that an overseas Filipino worker might enjoy. Filipinos travel abroad because they can earn more in a year by working for a shorter time in another country. Filipinos find it difficult to ensure a promising future for their family that will give financial stability due to the Philippines' uncertain economy, a lack of suitable jobs, and lower salaries paid by Philippine corporations. Remittances from Filipinos living abroad increased by 2.5 percent in 2022, rising from US$2.60 billion in January 2021 to US$2.67 billion in January 2022. With US$1.10 billion, or 41.2 percent of total remittances to the Philippines, the United States led the way, followed by Singapore with US$0.20 billion (7.4%), and Japan with US$0.16 billion (5.9 percent ). They can make a more significant pay while also assisting in alleviating homesickness. Because of technological advancements, Filipinos can quickly contact their relatives and friends in the Philippines. A person can quickly manage or contact their relatives via an internet connection, making it a straightforward and convenient way of reaching their loved ones at home. </p>

<p align = "justify"> Domestic work is an essential but sometimes overlooked aspect of Filipino culture. The tradition of employing domestic assistance has long been a part of Filipino society, and it is still practiced today. Similar customs, such as emigrating in search of work and housing less well-off relatives in exchange for home assistance, are also socially acceptable and expected. Domestic help is available and affordable, allowing women in the middle and upper-income levels to leave their household responsibilities and enter the workforce, contributing to the country's economic progress. On the other hand, domestic employment continues to be a hidden sector. The work is done behind closed doors, away from the reach of labor regulations and enforcement agencies. Domestic helpers are expected to labor continuously and for lengthy periods within families while becoming invisible. Domestic work is not considered a formal or informal occupation, and many people perceive it to be unskilled female labor. </p>

<p align = "justify"> The researchers will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis for Overseas Filipino Workers with these statements mentioned above. Furthermore, the datasets provided by Philippine Statistics Authority will be utilized. </p>

### Problem Statement

#### Decreasing Professional Worker in a Community.
<p align = "justify"> Since Filipino workers prefer to go overseas because of better salary opportunities, our country is losing a growing number of professional and hardworking individuals, which means a country needs skilled workers who will contribute to the improvement of society and the growth of the economy. </p>


#### Low Domestic Wages and Wage Differentials. 
<p align = "justify"> Most international migrants in Asia are motivated by the prospect of earning higher wages overseas (Smart et al. 1986). As long as potential foreign earnings exceed local wages (after subtracting costs of movement and job placement), workers are likely to respond to higher foreign wage rates by engaging in labour migration to one of the regionâ€™s core migrant-receiving countries (Abella, 1988). Low earning capacity and unemployment contribute to the widening income gap between the rich and the poor. The Philippines has one of Asia's worst income disparity records, with the rich being extremely wealthy and the poor being extremely impoverished. </p>


#### The Philippine peso's value is falling. 
<p align = "justify"> It is ironic that as the volume of dollar remittances to the Philippines increases, the value of a dollar decreases. This is because increased dollar reserves cause the greenback's value to fall against the peso. Because salaries are paid in foreign currencies influenced by the dollar-peso exchange rate, the peso value of OFW salaries falls. </p>


### Significance of the Proposed Project

#### To the Department of Labor and Employment. 
<p align = "justify"> This study will assist the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in identifying and analyzing the employment needs of a country so that Filipino workers would choose to work for it. It would also support them in improving the overall quality of their governance, allowing them to adopt new ideas. These will help to connect people and the government to facilitate communication, which will stand to gain the country's economy. </p>

#### To the Future Researchers. 
<p align = "justify"> The study's findings will be helpful to both existing and future researchers. It will be beneficial to researchers who want to organize better and execute their research, such as this one. This study was most likely one of the foundations for developing a new theory for data analysis. </p>

#### To the Public and Society. 
<p align = "justify"> This research will benefit both society and individuals since it will measure the statistics of Filipino workers who work for their families, allowing them to become more productive members of the community. It will assist citizens in becoming motivated to work, regardless of their gender, age, and status.
</p>

### Methods
<p align = "justify"> Our group is working on this project by obtaining information from the internet using our devices. We discussed how it could be done and completed properly. We all get along despite the fact that it is difficult to obtain accurate or trustworthy information. The information we gathered came from Filipino employees. According to the results of the 2019 Survey on Overseas Filipinos, the number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who worked abroad at any time between April and September 2019 was estimated to be 2.2 million. Overseas Contract Workers (OCWs), or those with a pre-existing work contract, made up 96.8 percent of all OFWs during the time period in question. The rest 3.2 percent worked without a contract in another country. According to the most recent report, the number of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), or Filipino workers who worked abroad between April and September 2020, is expected to be 1.77 million. </p>


### Expected Output
<p align = "justify"> This work aims to collect factual data to understand better the impact of overseas Filipino workers on our country's economic remittances. This project is a strategy for improving the interpretation and understanding of data collected through better visualization of concepts and ideas that are easier to grasp and understand by analyzing the significant impact on the country's economic development by alleviating poverty and ensuring consistent cash flow and circulation. It will also provide a clearer picture of future exploratory analysis for OFWs and determine whether it would be beneficial to help eliminate the issues mentioned above. The researchers will develop a policy and advocate for an action plan based on the data gathered, including all of the benefits available to OFWs in times of need. The information collected and tested will determine whether the country's convention and policy on economic remittances should be revised and implemented. Regardless of the dataset analysis outcome, policy, norms, and recommendations will be delivered and communicated to the entire nation to assess and evaluate what action is required next. It helps the team develop just government strategies that meet the needs of all Filipino overseas workers. This initiative makes the project's conclusion, summary, and recommendations available to all, particularly those most concerned about the country's future economic remittances. </p>

## Sustainable Development Goal
### No Poverty
<p align="center">
  <img width="190" height="190" src="https://github.com/apriljoyagquiz/IT3205-TeamAbracaData/blob/main/Datasets/NoPoverty.png">
</p>
<p align = "justify">SDG 1 seeks to eradicate poverty in all of its forms worldwide. Its goals include ensuring that everyone, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, has equal access to economic resources; basic services; property and land control; natural resources; and new technologies.</p>

<p align = "justify"> Poverty eradication is not a charitable endeavor; it is an act of justice and the key to unlocking vast human potential. Despite this, nearly half of the world's population is impoverished, and thousands die daily due to a lack of food and safe drinking water. We can feed the hungry, eradicate disease, and give everyone in the world a chance to prosper and live a productive and prosperous life if we all work together. </p>


### Decent Work and Economic Growth
<p align="center">
  <img width="190" height="190" src="https://github.com/apriljoyagquiz/IT3205-TeamAbracaData/blob/main/Datasets/decentwork.png">
</p>
<p align = "justify">SDG 8 aims to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, as well as job opportunities and decent work for all. This entails maintaining economic growth per capita in line with national circumstances and achieving annual GDP growth of at least 7% in less-developed countries. Policies that encourage productive activities and the creation of decent jobs, as well as entrepreneurship and innovation, are also required.
</p>

<p align = "justify"> Economic development should have benefited the entire planet. As a result, we must ensure that economic progress generates decent and fulfilling jobs while having no negative impact on the environment. We must defend workers' rights and end modern slavery and child labor. We can ensure that entrepreneurship and innovation benefit everyone by encouraging job creation and expanding access to banking and financial services. </p>
