<h1 align="center"> Exploratory Data Analysis for Overseas Filipino Workers. </h1> 

### Introduction

"Modern Day Heroes" is a title given for all Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) worldwide. They contribute to our country's economic progress through remittances. More importantly, they make personal sacrifices to provide a good living for their families despite homesickness. But working as an Overseas Filipino Worker is not always as straightforward as it appears. The truth is that they face a variety of problems in addition to abandoning their family in the Philippines to pursue a brighter future. Communication, finances, and the difficulties they face in their personal and professional lives are just a few of their issues.

The Philippines is the fourth-largest beneficiary of remittances from abroad. Remittances from OFWs, on the whole, help the country's economic development by alleviating poverty and ensuring a steady cash flow and circulation. OFW remittances have not only met the basic needs of their families, but they have also helped to keep the country's economy afloat by providing liquidity throughout global financial crises. OFW remittances are the country's second largest source of foreign reserves.

OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) are Filipinos who labor in other nations. They move overseas in search of better possibilities to support their family back home in the Philippines. Because the labor abroad is under contract with their employers, they are sometimes known as "Overseas Contract Workers" (OCWs). There are two category of overseas Filipino workers: those who leave the country for temporary or contract work and those who permanently stay in their target country. Temporary migrant workers, classed as either land-based or sea-based workers, are called Overseas Filipino Workers, while permanent migrants are referred to as emigrants.

A steady salary and additional employment perks are two advantages that an overseas Filipino worker might enjoy. Filipinos travel abroad because they can earn more in a year by working for a shorter time in another country. Filipinos find it difficult to ensure a promising future for their family that will give financial stability due to the Philippines' uncertain economy, a lack of suitable jobs, and lower salaries paid by Philippine corporations. Remittances from Filipinos living abroad increased by 2.5 percent in 2022, rising from US$2.60 billion in January 2021 to US$2.67 billion in January 2022. With US$1.10 billion, or 41.2 percent of total remittances to the Philippines, the United States led the way, followed by Singapore with US$0.20 billion (7.4%), and Japan with US$0.16 billion (5.9 percent ). They can make a more significant pay while also assisting in alleviating homesickness. Because of technological advancements, Filipinos can quickly contact their relatives and friends in the Philippines. A person can quickly manage or contact their relatives via an internet connection, making it a straightforward and convenient way of reaching their loved ones at home.

Domestic work is an essential but sometimes overlooked aspect of Filipino culture. The tradition of employing domestic assistance has long been a part of Filipino society, and it is still practiced today. Similar customs, such as emigrating in search of work and housing less well-off relatives in exchange for home assistance, are also socially acceptable and expected. Domestic help is available and affordable, allowing women in the middle and upper-income levels to leave their household responsibilities and enter the workforce, contributing to the country's economic progress. On the other hand, domestic employment continues to be a hidden sector. The work is done behind closed doors, away from the reach of labor regulations and enforcement agencies. Domestic helpers are expected to labor continuously and for lengthy periods within families while becoming invisible. Domestic work is not considered a formal or informal occupation, and many people perceive it to be unskilled female labor.

The researchers will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis for Overseas Filipino Workers with these statements mentioned above. Furthermore, the datasets provided by Philippine Statistics Authority will be utilized.

### Problem Statement

#### Decreasing Professional Worker in a Community.
Since Filipino workers prefer to go overseas because of better salary opportunities, our country is losing a growing number of professional and hardworking individuals, which means a country needs skilled workers who will contribute to the improvement of society and the growth of the economy.


#### Low Domestic Wages and Wage Differentials. 
Most international migrants in Asia are motivated by the prospect of earning higher wages overseas (Smart et al. 1986). As long as potential foreign earnings exceed local wages (after subtracting costs of movement and job placement), workers are likely to respond to higher foreign wage rates by engaging in labour migration to one of the regionâ€™s core migrant-receiving countries (Abella, 1988). Low earning capacity and unemployment contribute to the widening income gap between the rich and the poor. The Philippines has one of Asia's worst income disparity records, with the rich being extremely wealthy and the poor being extremely impoverished.


#### The Philippine peso's value is falling. 
It is ironic that as the volume of dollar remittances to the Philippines increases, the value of a dollar decreases. This is because increased dollar reserves cause the greenback's value to fall against the peso. Because salaries are paid in foreign currencies influenced by the dollar-peso exchange rate, the peso value of OFW salaries falls.
#### Decreasing Professional Worker in a Community.  
Since Filipino workers prefer to go overseas because of better salary opportunities, our country is losing a growing number of professional and hardworking individuals, which means a country needs skilled workers who will contribute to the improvement of society and the growth of the economy.


### Significance of the Proposed Project

#### To the Department of Labor and Employment. 
This study will assist the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in identifying and analyzing the employment needs of a country so that Filipino workers would choose to work for it. It would also support them in improving the overall quality of their governance, allowing them to adopt new ideas. These will help to connect people and the government to facilitate communication, which will stand to gain the country's economy.

#### To the Future Researchers. 
The study's findings will be helpful to both existing and future researchers. It will be beneficial to researchers who want to organize better and execute their research, such as this one. This study was most likely one of the foundations for developing a new theory for data analysis.

#### To the Public and Society. 
This research will benefit both society and individuals since it will measure the statistics of Filipino workers who work for their families, allowing them to become more productive members of the community. It will assist citizens in becoming motivated to work, regardless of their gender, age, and status.


### Methods
Our group is working on this project by obtaining information from the internet using our devices. We discussed how it could be done and completed properly. We all get along despite the fact that it is difficult to obtain accurate or trustworthy information. The information we gathered came from Filipino employees. According to the results of the 2019 Survey on Overseas Filipinos, the number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who worked abroad at any time between April and September 2019 was estimated to be 2.2 million. Overseas Contract Workers (OCWs), or those with a pre-existing work contract, made up 96.8 percent of all OFWs during the time period in question. The rest 3.2 percent worked without a contract in another country. According to the most recent report, the number of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), or Filipino workers who worked abroad between April and September 2020, is expected to be 1.77 million.


### Expected Output
This project aims to collect factual data to understand better the impact of overseas Filipino workers on our country's economic remittances. This project is a plan to improve the interpretation and understanding of the data collected through better visualization of concepts and ideas that are easier to grasp and understand by analyzing the significant impact on the country's economic development by alleviating poverty and ensuring a consistent cash flow and circulation. It will also provide a clearer picture of the potential exploratory analysis for OFWs in the future and determine whether or not it would be beneficial to help eliminate the issues mentioned above. Based on the data gathered, the researchers will develop a policy and advocate for an action plan that includes all of the benefits available to OFWs in times of need. The data gathered and tested will determine whether or not the country's convention and policy against economic remittances should be revised and implemented. Regardless of the dataset analysis outcome, awareness of policies, norms, and recommendations will be delivered and communicated to the entire nation to assess and evaluate what action is needed next. It assists the team in developing just government strategies that meet the needs of every Filipino overseas worker. This initiative makes the project's conclusion, summary, and recommendation available to all, especially those most concerned about the country's future economic remittance.

## Sustainable Development Goal
### No Poverty

</p>

Poverty eradication is not a charitable task; it is an act of justice and the key to unlocking enormous human potential. Despite this, nearly half of the world's population is impoverished, and a lack of food and clean water kills thousands every day of the year. We can feed the hungry, eradicate disease, and give everyone in the world a chance to prosper and live a productive and rich life if we work together.


### Decent Work and Economic Growth

Economic growth should have been a positive factor for the entire planet. As a result, we must ensure that financial progress creates decent and fulfilling jobs while not negatively impacting the environment. We must protect labor rights and put an end to modern slavery and child labor once and for all. We can ensure that everyone benefits from entrepreneurship and innovation if we encourage job creation and expand access to banking and financial services.
