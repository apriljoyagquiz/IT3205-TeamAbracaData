## Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis for Overseas Filipino Workers

#### Introduction

"Modern Day Heroes" is a fantastic title for all Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) worldwide. They are heroes who have left their families and valued their country to assist their loved ones and families. But working as an Overseas Filipino Worker is not always as straightforward as it appears. The truth is that they face a variety of problems in addition to abandoning their family in the Philippines to pursue a brighter future. Communication, finances, and the difficulties they face in their personal and professional lives are just a few of their issues.

OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) are Filipinos who labor in other nations. They move overseas in search of better possibilities to support their family back home in the Philippines. Because the labor abroad is under contract with their employers, they are sometimes known as "Overseas Contract Workers" (OCWs). There are two category of overseas Filipino workers: those who leave the country for temporary or contract work and those who permanently stay in their target country. Temporary migrant workers, classed as either land-based or sea-based workers, are called Overseas Filipino Workers, while permanent migrants are referred to as emigrants.

A steady salary and additional employment perks are two advantages that an overseas Filipino worker might enjoy. Filipinos travel abroad because they can earn more in a year by working for a shorter time in another country. Filipinos find it difficult to ensure a promising future for their family that will give financial stability due to the Philippines' uncertain economy, a lack of suitable jobs, and lower salaries paid by Philippine corporations. They can make a more significant pay while also assisting in alleviating homesickness. Because of technological advancements, Filipinos can quickly contact their relatives and friends in the Philippines. A person can quickly manage or contact their relatives via an internet connection, making it a straightforward and convenient way of reaching their loved ones at home.

Domestic work is an essential but sometimes overlooked aspect of Filipino culture. The tradition of employing domestic assistance has long been a part of Filipino society, and it is still practiced today. Similar customs, such as emigrating in search of work and housing less well-off relatives in exchange for home assistance, are also socially acceptable and expected. Domestic help is available and affordable, allowing women in the middle and upper-income levels to leave their household responsibilities and enter the workforce, contributing to the country's economic progress. On the other hand, domestic employment continues to be a hidden sector. The work is done behind closed doors, away from the reach of labor regulations and enforcement agencies. Domestic helpers are expected to labor continuously and for lengthy periods within families while becoming invisible. Domestic work is not considered a formal or informal occupation, and many people perceive it to be unskilled female labor.

The researchers will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis for Overseas Filipino Workers with these statements mentioned above. Furthermore, the datasets provided by Philippine Statistics Authority will be utilized.

#### Problem Statement

#### Decreasing Professional Worker in a Community.
Since Filipino workers prefer to go overseas because of better salary opportunities, our country is losing a growing number of professional and hardworking individuals, which means a country needs skilled workers who will contribute to the improvement of society and the growth of the economy.


#### Low Domestic Wages and Wage Differentials. 
Most international migrants in Asia are motivated by the prospect of earning higher wages overseas (Smart et al. 1986). As long as potential foreign earnings exceed local wages (after subtracting costs of movement and job placement), workers are likely to respond to higher foreign wage rates by engaging in labour migration to one of the regionâ€™s core migrant-receiving countries (Abella, 1988). Low earning capacity and unemployment contribute to the widening income gap between the rich and the poor. The Philippines has one of the worst income disparity records in Asia where the rich are very rich and the poor are very poor.


#### The Philippine peso's value is falling. 
It is ironic that as the volume of dollar remittances to the Philippines increases, the value of a dollar decreases. This is because increased dollar reserves cause the greenback's value to fall against the peso. Because salaries are paid in foreign currencies influenced by the dollar-peso exchange rate, the peso value of OFW salaries falls.
#### Decreasing Professional Worker in a Community.  
Since Filipino workers prefer to go overseas because of better salary opportunities, our country is losing a growing number of professional and hardworking individuals, which means a country needs skilled workers who will contribute to the improvement of society and the growth of the economy.


#### Significance of the Proposed Project

#### To the Department of Labor and Employment. 
This study will assist the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in identifying and analyzing the employment needs of a country so that Filipino workers would choose to work for it. It would also support them in improving the overall quality of their governance, allowing them to adopt new ideas. These will help connect people and the government to facilitate communication, which will stand to gain the country's economy.

#### To the Future Researchers. 
The study's findings will be helpful to both existing and future researchers. It will be beneficial to researchers who want to organize better and execute their research, such as this one. This study was most likely one of the foundations for developing a new theory for data analysis.

#### To the Public and Society. 
This research will benefit both society and individuals since it will measure the statistics of Filipino workers who work for their families, allowing them to become more productive members of the community. It will assist citizens in becoming motivated to work, regardless of their gender, age, and status.


#### Methods
Our group is working on this project by using our devices to obtain information from the internet. We spoke about how it could be done and completed appropriately. Despite the fact that it is difficult to acquire accurate or trustworthy information, we all get along. The data we collected came from Filipino employees. The number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who worked abroad at any time between April and September 2019 was estimated to be 2.2 million, according to the results of the 2019 Survey on Overseas Filipinos. Overseas Contract Workers (OCWs), or those with an established work contract, accounted for 96.8% of all OFWs during the time in question. The remaining 3.2 percent worked overseas without a contract. The number of Overseas Filipino Laborers (OFWs) or Filipino workers who worked overseas during April to September 2020 was anticipated to be 1.77 million, according to the most recent report.


#### Expected Output
This project's goal is to collect factual data that will be used to gain a better understanding of Filipino workers working abroad. This project aims to improve data understanding and interpretation by analyzing the significance of Filipino workers abroad through better visualization of concepts and ideas that are easier to grasp and understand.
