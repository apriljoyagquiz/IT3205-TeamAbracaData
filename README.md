## Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis for Overseas Filipino Workers

#### Introduction

#### Problem Statement

Decreasing Professional Worker in a Community.  Since Filipino workers prefer to go overseas because of better salary opportunities, our country is losing a growing number of professional and hardworking individuals, which means a country needs skilled workers who will contribute to the improvement of society and the growth of the economy.


#### Significance of the Proposed Project

To the Department of Labor and Employment. This study will assist the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in identifying and analyzing the employment needs of a country so that Filipino workers would choose to work for it. It would also support them in improving the overall quality of their governance, allowing them to adopt new ideas. These will help connect people and the government to facilitate communication, which will stand to gain the country's economy.

To the Future Researchers. The study's findings will be helpful to both existing and future researchers. It will be beneficial to researchers who want to organize better and execute their research, such as this one. This study was most likely one of the foundations for developing a new theory for data analysis.

To the Public and Society. This research will benefit both society and individuals since it will measure the statistics of Filipino workers who work for their families, allowing them to become more productive members of the community. It will assist citizens in becoming motivated to work, regardless of their gender, age, and status.
